Following modules were used in the solutiuons:
  --> OpenCV - Module that contains functions with real-time computer vision capabilities.
  --> NumPy - Module that contains functions to perform certain complex math functions.
  
Single Pedestrian:
  1. A tracking ball of radius 40 was created to follow around the target ball.
  2. The position of tracking ball was constantly updated to track the target ball.
  3. Once every hundred frame collections, direction, velocity and acceleration were updated.
  4. Constant updation for each frame would make it difficult to track actual velocity in real-time.
  5. Given the ball's constant flickering, error-prone velocity, acceleration were avoided.
  
  Note:
  Direction is in the form of x i + y j
    where, i and j are unit vectors along x and y axes respectively.
    
Multiple Pedestrians:
  1. Multiple tracking balls were created to track the motion of individual balls,
  2. Whenever a ball was detected, a pink circle was formed around it.
  3. Just like previous problem, required parameters were computed.
  
  However, tracking wasn't as efficient due to following reasons:
    1. Multiple balls of different sizes
    2. One tracking ball wasn't able to stay consistent with one ball due to constant overlapping.
